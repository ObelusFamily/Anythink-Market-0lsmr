Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

Below are the steps to setup the project locally

1) Clone the repo (Do not fork it please)
2) Ensure you have docker compose locally [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)
    - You can check the installation using the command `docker -v` and `docker-compose -v`
3) Start the backend and frontend from the container using the command `docker-compose up`
    - The backend will be mapped to the port `3000` and the frontend on port `3001`
